<h3>Heraclitus of Ephesus: Selected Fragments</h3>

<p>THE PATH OF INVESTIGATION</p>

<p>1. Although this Logos is eternally valid, yet men are unable to understand it -- not only before hearing it, but even after they have heard it for the first time. That is to say, although all things come to pass in accordance with this Logos, men seem to be quite without any experience of it - at least if they are judged in the light of such words and deeds as I am here setting forth.</p>

<p>2. We should let ourselves be guided by what is common to all. Yet, although the Logos is common to all, most men live as if each of them had a private intelligence of his own.</p>

<p>3. Men who love wisdom should acquaint themselves with a great many particulars.</p>

<p>4. Seekers after gold dig up much earth and find little.</p>

<p>5. Let us not make arbitrary conjectures about the greatest matters.</p>

<p>6. Much learning does not teach understanding, otherwise it would have taught Hesiod and Pythagoras, Xenophanes and Hecataeus.</p>

<p>7. Of those whose discourses I have heard there is not one who attains to the realization that wisdom stands apart from all else.</p>

<p>8. I have searched myself.</p>

<p>9. It pertains to all men to know themselves and to be temperate.</p>

<p>10. To be temperate is the greatest virtue. Wisdom consists in speaking and acting the truth, giving heed to the nature of things.</p>

<p>11. The things of which there can be sight, hearing, and learning ---- these are what I especially prize.</p>

<p>12. Eyes are more accurate witnesses than ears.</p>

<p>13. Eyes and ears are bad witnesses to men having barbarian souls.</p>

<p>14. One should not act or speak as if he were asleep.</p>

<p>15. The waking have one world. in common, whereas each sleeper turns away to a private world of his own.</p>

<p>16. Whatever we see when awake is death; when asleep, dreams.</p>

<p>17. Nature loves to hide itself.</p>

<p>18. The lord whose oracle is at Delphi neither speaks nor conceals, but gives signs.</p>

<p>19. Unless you expect the unexpected you will never find truth, for it is hard to discover and hard to attain.</p>

<p>THE IDEA OF THE CONTINUUM</p>

<p>20. Everything flows and nothing abides;. Everything gives way and nothing stays fixed.</p>

<p>21. You cannot step twice into the same river, for other waters and yet others go ever flowing on.</p>

<p>22. Cool things become warm, the warm grows cool; the moist dries, the parched becomes moist.</p>

<p>23. It is in changing that things find repose.</p>

<p>24. Time is a child moving counters in a game; the royal power is a child's.</p>

<p>25. War is both father and king of all; some he has shown forth as gods and others as men, some he has made slaves and others free.</p>

<p>26. It should be understood that war is the common condition, that strife is justice, and that all things come to pass through the compulsion of strife.</p>

<p>27. Homer was wrong in saying, "Would that strife might perish from amongst gods and men. For if that were to occur, then all things would cease to exist.</p>

<p>ON NATURE</p>

<p>28. There is exchange of all things for fire and of fire for all things, as there is of wares for gold and of gold for wares.</p>

<p>29. This universe, which is the same for all, has not been made by any god or man, but it always has been is, and will be -- an ever-living fire, kindling itself by regular measures and going out by regular measures.</p>

<p>30. The phases of fire are craving and satiety.</p>

<p>31. It throws apart and then brings together again; it advances and retires.</p>

<p>32. The transformations of fire -- first, sea; and of sea, half becomes earth and half the lightning-flash.</p>

<p>33. When earth has melted into sea, the resultant amount is the same as there had been before sea became hardened into earth.</p>

<p>34. Fire lives in the death of earth, air in the death of fire, water in the death of air, and earth in the death of water.</p>

<p>35. The thunderbolt pilots all things.</p>

<p>36. The sun is new each day.</p>

<p>37. The sun is the breadth of a man's foot.</p>

<p>38. If there were no sun, the other stars would not suffice to prevent its being night.</p>

<p>39. The boundary line of evening and morning is the Bear; and opposite the Bear is the boundary of bright Zeus.</p>

<p>40. The fairest universe is but a heap of rubbish piled up at random.</p>

<p>41. Every beast is driven to pasture by a blow.</p>

<p>ON THE SPIRITUAL</p>

<p>42. You could not discover the limits of soul, even if you traveled by every path in order to do so; such is the depth of its meaning.</p>

<p>43. Soul is the vaporization out of which everything else is composed; more-over it is the least corporeal of things and is in ceaseless flux, for the moving world can only be known by what is in motion.</p>

<p>44. Souls are vaporized from what is moist.</p>

<p>45. Soul has its own inner law of growth.</p>

<p>46. A dry soul is wisest and best. (or) The best and wisest soul is a dry beam of light.</p>

<p>47. Souls take pleasure in becoming moist.</p>

<p>48. A drunken man has to be led by a boy, whom he follows stumbling and not knowing whither he goes, for his soul is moist.</p>

<p>49. It is death to souls to become water, and it is death to water to become earth. Conversely, water comes into existence out of earth, and souls out of water.</p>

<p>50. Even the sacred barley drink separates when it is not stirred.</p>

<p>51. It is hard to fight against impulsive desire; whatever it wants it will buy at the cost of the soul.</p>

<p>52. It would not be better if things happened to men just as they wish.</p>

<p>53. Although it is better to hide our ignorance, this is hard to do when we relax over wine.</p>

<p>54. A foolish man is a-flutter at every word.</p>

<p>55. Fools, although they hear, are like the deaf: To them the adage applies that when present they are absent.</p>

<p>56. Bigotry is the sacred disease.</p>

<p>57. Most people do not take heed of the things they encounter, nor do they grasp them even when they have learned about them, although they think they do.</p>

<p>58. If all existing things were smoke, it is by smell that we would distinguish them.</p>

<p>59. In Hades souls perceive by smelling.</p>

<p>60. Corpses are more fit to be thrown out than dung.</p>

<p>ON THE DIVINE</p>

<p>61. Human nature has no real understanding; only the divine nature has it.</p>

<p>62. Man is not rational; there is intelligence only in what encompasses him.</p>

<p>63. What is divine escapes men's notice because of their incredulity.</p>

<p>64. Although intimately connected with the Logos, men keep setting themselves against it.</p>

<p>65. As in the nighttime a man kindles for himself (haptetai) a light, so when a living man lies down in death with his vision extinguished he attaches himself (haptetai) to the state of death; even as one who has been awake lies down with his vision extinguished and attaches himself to the state of Sleep.</p>

<p>66. Immortals become mortals, mortals become immortals; they live in each other's death and die in each other's life.</p>

<p>67. There await men after death such things as they neither expect nor have any conception of.</p>

<p>68. They arise into wakefulness and become guardians of the living and the dead.</p>

<p>69. A man's character is his guardian divinity.</p>

<p>70. Greater dooms win greater destinies.</p>

<p>71. Justice will overtake fabricators of lies and false witnesses.</p>

<p>72. Fire in its advance will catch all things by surprise and judge them.</p>

<p>73. How can anyone hide from that which never sets?</p>

<p>74. (The mind) speaks in vain, because it does not know itself.</p>

<p>75. A life spent in the search for knowledge is a life that remains untouched by falsehoods.</p>

<p>76. There is a touch of wisdom in the man who has great ideas.</p>

<p>77. There is no greater good than the excellence of a man who has completed his task.</p>

<p>78. Divine logic has a tendency to bring forth two opposing forces which both play their part to achieve progress.</p>
